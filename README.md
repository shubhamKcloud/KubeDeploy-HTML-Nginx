# Kubernetes Nginx HTML Deployment

## Project Overview

This project aims to deploy a basic HTML page using Nginx on a Kubernetes cluster. The HTML content you want to showcase will be served through the Nginx web server, and Kubernetes will handle the deployment and management of the application.

## Key Components

1. **HTML Page:** Create an HTML page with the content you want to share.
2. **Nginx:** Utilize Nginx as the web server to serve your HTML content.
3. **Kubernetes:** Leverage Kubernetes for efficient container orchestration and application management.

## How It Works

1. **HTML Content:** Develop your HTML page with the desired content.
2. **Nginx Web Server:** Use Nginx to handle incoming requests and serve your HTML page.
3. **Kubernetes Deployment:** Deploy Nginx and your HTML page on a Kubernetes cluster for scalability and reliability.
4. **Accessibility:** Once deployed, your HTML page becomes accessible on the internet through the Nginx server running on Kubernetes.

## Benefits

- **Scalability:** Easily scale your application as traffic grows.
- **Reliability:** Ensure continuous operation with Kubernetes' robust management capabilities.
- **Easy Deployment:** Simplify deployment and management processes with Kubernetes.

## Outcome

Users can access your HTML page online, served by Nginx running on a Kubernetes cluster. This provides a reliable and scalable platform for showcasing your web content.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to deploy your HTML page using Nginx on Kubernetes:
1. Build docker image 
2. Push to your Artifactory
3. Deploy on your Kubernetes cluster

Happy coding!
